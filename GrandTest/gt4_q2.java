You are designing an autonomous surveillance drone that operates 
over an infinite 2D grid representing terrain coordinates.

The drone starts at position (0, 0).

In a single step, the drone can move in an L-shaped pattern. From 
a position (p, q), it can move to any of the following positions:
(p − 2, q − 1), (p − 2, q + 1), (p + 2, q − 1), (p + 2, q + 1)
(p − 1, q + 2), (p + 1, q + 2), (p − 1, q − 2), (p + 1, q − 2)

Given two integers m and n, representing the target position (m, n), determine:
The minimum number of steps required for the drone to reach the target 
from (0, 0).


Input Format:
-----------------
Two space separated integers, m and n, position.

Output Format:
------------------
Print an integer, minimum number of steps to reach (m,n).


Sample Input-1:
---------------
2 4

Sample Output-1:
----------------
2

Explanation:
-------------
Initially, you are at (0,0) position, you can reach (2,4) as follows:
(0,0) -> (1, 2) -> (2, 4) 


Sample Input-2:
---------------
4 7

Sample Output-2:
----------------
5

Explanation:
------------
Initially, you are at (0,0) position, you can reach (4,7) as follows:
(0,0) -> (1, 2) -> (2, 4) -> (1, 6) -> (3, 5) -> (4, 7)
