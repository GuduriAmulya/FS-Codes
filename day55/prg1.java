/*
A Telephone Line Company (TLC) is establishing a new telephone cable network 
among several places numbered by integers from 1 to N. Each place has exactly 
one telephone exchange. Lines connecting these exchanges are bidirectional, 
and it's possible to reach every place from every other place, directly or 
indirectly through other exchanges.

Occasionally, an exchange might fail due to power outages. If the failure of an 
exchange makes it impossible for some other exchanges to communicate, 
the failed exchange is considered critical.
Write a Java program to count and output the number of critical places in this network.

Input format:
-------------
The first line contains an integer N (< 100), representing the number of places.
Each subsequent line contains a place number followed by numbers representing places directly connected to it.
The block of input ends with a single line containing 0.

Output format:
--------------
An integer, the number of critical places.

Example 1:
----------
Input=
5
5 1 2 3 4
0

Output=
1

Explanation:
       5
    / | \ \
   1  2  3 4

Removing place 5: Disconnects places {1, 2, 3, 4}, as there is no other path between them.


Example 2:
----------
Input=
4
1 2
2 3
3 4
0

Output= 2

Explanation:
Places form a linear chain:
1 - 2 - 3 - 4

Critical places:
- 2 (disconnects 1 from {3,4})
- 3 (disconnects 4 from {1,2})
